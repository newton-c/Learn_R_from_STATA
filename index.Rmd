# Welcome

*R for STATA Users* is a book designed to take researchers that are already profecient in STATA, and show them how to do the same analyses in R. The hope is that by starting with what the reader already knows and showing how to replicate their code in R, the transition to open source software will be gentle. After covering the basics, the book then moves on to more R specific lessons that may introduce techniques that aren't commonly seen in STATA. 

This is currently a work in progress with most of the chapters just outlines. As I progress, I'll coutinuously update this website.
