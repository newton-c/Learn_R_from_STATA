# R for STATA Users

## Note: I'm just starting to put this book together. It's not ready for public consumption quite yet. I'll change this note when things are a bit more developed.

*R for STATA Users* is a book designed to take researchers that are already is profecient in STATA, and show them how to do the same analyses in R. The hope is that by starting with what the reader is already comfrotable and showing how to replicate their code in R, the transition to open source software will be gentle. After covering the basics, the book then moves on to more R specific lessons that may introduce techniques that aren't commonly seen in STATA. 

A pdf of the book as it currently stands is under \_book/Newton-R\_for\_STATA.pdf
