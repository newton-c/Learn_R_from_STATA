# Why switch to R

If you've gotten this far, I'm assuming that you're already profeceint in STATA. Maybe you're a seasoned researcher with scores of publications on you CV. Maybe you're a grad student, recently emerged from the gauntlet of stats class after stats class, having learned STATA along the way. Perhaps you're asking yourself, Why would I re-learn how to do something I already know? 

The answer for many of you is: You shouldn't. Some people don't need to leard R, especially considering that they've already learned how to do everything they need to do in STATA. For everyone else, here are some good reasons to make the switch (or at least learn *some* R).

1. **R is free**

R is an open source programing language available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. This means that anyone can download it, use it, publish results, develop packages, and other fun stuff without spending any money. Seriously, it's 100% free. 100%. All versions, updates, extra packages, even some books, free. No need for temporary lisences, shelling out for perpetual liscences, buyng new versions, getting your institution to buy it for you, or borrowing that sketchy thumb drive that one person has (not that any reader every pirated anything). It's all free.

2. **R is free**

Seriously, though. It's free. Even if this doesn't matter to you, if you teach, it likely matters to your students. College is expensive, especially if you go for a really long time, like getting a Ph.D. Even for students with scholarships and funding, the financial burden can be tough. Not having to by software, on top of buying an overpriced statistics textbook (the latest edition only!), can make a big difference.

3. **R is the preferred language of statisticians and methodologists in many fields**

If you want to be at the forefront of statistics or your chosen field, there's a good chance that the latest developments are going to come in the form of new R packages before they spreads to any other language. Even before R packages are published, people often post their work on GitHub to be downloaded and used as you will. 

4. **R is a programing language**

Getting comfortable in R means learning some fundanamentals of how to write basic code. While with can be extended to developing entire programs in R, learning a bit about functions and loops may mean suffering through a bit of a learning curve, but it will make you life easier down the road. Especially when it come to tedious repetitive tasks, learing a bit about coding can save you lots of time and energy. Learning R means getting comfortable with some of the more basic coding principals.

This also means that learning other prograing languages will be easier. All languages employ the same basic logic, with some variation. Understading how one languages works, means it will be a lot easier to learn another. With maching learning, text analysis, and web development becoming increaasingly popular in Python, this techniques may be some you'll need to learn down the road. Learning the fundamentals in this book can serve at the floaties in the shallow end before diving in the deep end.

5. **Graphics**

R's libraies from visualization -- ggplot2 in particular -- can produce everything from publication ready graphs, to maps, to animated 3D graphs. The possibilites are vast with other programing builing libraries to imitate the R's. While a web developer creating data visulizations may prefer something such as D3.js that easily runs in a browser, for most researcher, it's hard to beat R when it comes to visualizing you datasets and results. 

6. **Boredom**

Sometimes we just want to do things a bit different. Tired of using STATA all the time, use R?

7. **To be condescending to your collegues**

\- Oh, you use STATA? That's cute. I use R, like a *real* statistician.

## In conclusion...
As you can see, some of these reasons are better than others. Maybe they all fit your situation, maybe none do. For those that are commited, let write some R code.
